# Firefox Addon

The Mom Addon

This is a very simple firefox extension that displays a page of your mom asking what you are up to every 20 minutes firefox is open. It is meant for the easily distracted/addicted. 

To install, open: mom.xpi

For those who would like a personalized version of this extension, you can contact me:

(e.g. Different picture/color/wording/time between popping up pages, etc.)

Next version will have preference options.

Other Recommended Firefox App: Leechblock
